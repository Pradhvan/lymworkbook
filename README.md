## Work for the LYM book

This is a fresh workbook for the LYM readers. This is using Vagrant to build up the vm, you can 
actually use it in a normal vm too. Make sure that you have a `vagrant` user and you can ssh into
the vm from your normal work computer. Also, this user should be able to do `sudo` without password.

## TODO (Add steps for the above mentioned things)
